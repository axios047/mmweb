            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected through the web sites located at Kubric.io, Moodmagic.app and the Kubric App(s) (collectively, the web site and the app, the “Platform”); whether accessed via computer, mobile device or other technology. The Platform is offered by Kubric LLC, who is the data controller (“Kubric”, “we”, “us”, “our”). This Privacy Policy explains what information may be collected through the Platform, how such information may be used and/or shared with others, how we safeguard it and how you may access and control its use in connection with our marketing communications and business activities.</p>
            <h2>Information we collect</h2>
            <h3>INFORMATION YOU GIVE US</h3>
            <p>When you use the Platform, for example to register to create an account, update your information, sign up for a subscription, use certain features, access or download content, purchase items or enter into promotions, refer others to the Platform, interact with us via third party application or social media sites, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us, we or our service providers or business partners may collect information that relates to you, including personal information, such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, mobile phone number, credit card or debit card details, geographic location, mailing address, date of birth, gender, demographic information, photos, videos, social media account details and other information from your device. You may decide to provide us with another person's email or phone number so that person may be invited to join Kubric or so that we may facilitate your communication with other people through the service. Local law may require you to seek the consent of your contacts to provide their personal information to SaKubricavn, who may use that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <h3>INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY</h3>
            <p>Whenever you visit or interact with the Platform, Kubric, as well as any third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Platform is accessed and used (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may include information collected in the following ways: Log Files: Information is logged about your use of the Platforms, including your browser type, operating system, activations, content you purchase, access, download or burn, access and listening times, the page served and the preceding page views. This statistical usage data provides us with information about the use of the Platform, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Platform, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on. It also provides us with information about your interactions with songs, playlists, audiovisual content and other Kubric users, as well as advertising and products or services offered through or linked from the Platform. This information helps us keep our Platform fresh and interesting to our visitors and tailor content to a visitor’s interests. Location Information: We may collect information about the location of your device when you access or use the Platform; or if you choose to turn on your Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or other geolocation functionality when you use the App, subject to your consent, the App may collect and use your geolocation information. We may share your location with certain third-parties for analytics and advertising purposes. Device Identifiers: Kubric may automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for the computer, mobile device, tablet or other device (collectively, “Device”) you use to access the Platform, including the hardware model and mobile network information. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a web site or its servers, and includes AD-IDs or IDFAs, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. We may use a Device Identifier to, among other things, administer the Platform, help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, track users’ web page movements, help identify, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Cookies, Pixel Tags The technologies used on the Platform to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, may include but are not limited to: cookies (data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Platform), mobile analytics software and pixel tags (transparent graphic image, sometimes called a web beacon or tracking beacon, placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed). Cookies may also be used to associate you with social networking sites and, if you so choose, enable interaction between your activities on the Platform and your activities on such social networking sites. We, or our vendors, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to collect information enabling digital rights management, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Platform (such as allowing us to select which content, ads or offers are most likely to appeal to you, based on your interests, preferences, location, or demographic information). Personalized content may also include content from the providers of goods and services that you may be able to purchase through the Platform or otherwise (who may pay us to show you such content). Similarly, we may use analytics platforms and other tracking technologies to help us track and analyze usage of our Platform, using cookies, pixels and other tracking technologies.</p>
            <h3>INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM OTHER SOURCES</h4>
            <p>We also may obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through the Platform. For example, if you create an account using your credentials from a third-party social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, profile and account information, such as lists of your friends, 'likes', comments you have shared, groups and location, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such third-party social media site. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on our Platform to your profile page to share with others within your network. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party application or website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their 'connections' or information about you is otherwise accessible through your 'connections' web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party website or interactive service. You may integrate your Kubric account with third party applications and sites. If you do, we may receive similar information related to your interactions with the Kubric service on the third party application, as well as information about your publicly available activity on the third party application or site. We may also receive information about you from our partners and service providers, (including, for example, business partners, analytics vendors, advertising networks and search information providers) which we use to personalize your Kubric experience, to measure ad quality and responses, and to display ads that are more likely to be relevant to you.</p>
            <h2>Use of collected information</h2>
